                <p>
                    Project Cosmo provided Rowan University with its first ever alcohol research lab on campus under the guidance of Dr. DJ Angelone!! Project Cosmo is designed to test alcohol’s effect on cognitive processing (visual, auditory, and abstract reasoning) with women ages 21-30, who are single and social drinkers.

                <h4>The Young Mothers' Relationship Project (YMRP)</h4>
                <p>
                    YMRP is a Rowan seed grant-funded pilot study supervised by Dr. Meredith Joppa. This study involves a one-time interview and survey for young women, ages 16-21, who have at least one biological child living with them. We are interested in learning more about young moms’ experiences with dating, with the goal of developing a program to help young moms have healthier romantic relationships. For more information about how to participate, click here, call 856-256-4500 x3778, or e-mail us at rowanymrp@gmail.com.

                <h4>Themes in the Media</h4>
                <p>
                    Is an in-person study held at Rowan University under the guidance of Dr. DJ Angelone. Themes in the Media is a 1.5 hour experiment where a male and female participant are invited to the Psychology Department to provide their feedback on current media clips taken from movies or television series. After watching a series of clips and rating them, the two participants will draw one of two roles from a hat; one participant will be a watcher and the other distributor. The study is designed to understand what types of media footage are appealing to college students. Once the experiment is over, participants are instructed to complete a variety of demographic and personality measures.

                <h4>Study Abroad</h4>
                <p>
                    Over the past 7 years, the ASSeRT Lab has had several students become involved with research on study abroad students and their directors. Several survey projects have been designed to understand study abroad students engagement in risky sexual activity, alcohol consumption and sexual assault experiences. In addition to the several quantitative projects designed to examine this population, Dr. Angelone and Dr. Joppa have collaborated with a student to design a mixed method project examining study abroad program delivery. The project is a two fold process that required qualitative coding of over 1,000 schools, followed by a survey disseminated to directors of study abroad programs across the county. The overall project has yielded two manuscripts and over 20 research presentations and posters.

                <h4>PTSD, Alcohol and Assault</h4>
                <p>
                    Originally designed for two thesis students, this survey project has become a point of interest to the ASSeRT Lab. With over 800 participants, the data provides a well-rounded view on college women’s experiences prior to attending college and their first few years into it. This study was designed to understand sexual assault experiences women might have in high school and college along with their PTSD symptomology, alcohol and drug use, and consequences following.

                <h4>Relationship Risk Behavior Prevention Research</h4>
                <p>
                    Dr. Joppa continues to collaborate with colleagues at Brown, Northeastern, and community organizations to analyze data from HIV and dating violence prevention interventions. These include Project Date SMART, an intervention to reduce dating violence and sexual risk behavior for dating-violence-involved adolescent girls (PI: Christie Rizzo, Ph.D.), Project TRAC, a program for early adolescents with mental health problems (PI: Chris Houck, Ph.D.), and the Katie Brown Educational Program (KBEP), a non-profit dedicated to teaching alternatives to dating violence.

                <h4>GIFTS</h4>
                <p>
                    NA and AA are two of the largest peer support models for substance abuse and addictions, yet it can be difficult to examine the population that attends these meetings. Dr. Angelone and Professor Assini collaborated with a professor at the University of Connecticut to design and implement a survey to assess this NA and AA member’s length of recovery, time sober, and reasons for sobriety. Together they collected data from over 300 members of the two organizations. This study also provided empirical support for a new measure called the GIFTS, which was designed by Professor Assini, Dr. Angelone and Dr. Mitchell.

                <h4>Healthy Relationships for Student Athletes</h4>
                <p>
                    Dr. Angelone and Dr. Joppa are collaborating on this mixed-method exploratory project to examine the prevalence and correlates of college student athletes’ relationship risk behaviors, including dating violence and sexual assault, with the goal of developing an intervention to promote healthy relationships for student athletes.

                <h4>Attachment and Medical Specialty Choice</h4>

                    In collaboration with colleagues at the Rowan School of Osteopathic Medicine- Justin Faden, D.O., and Elina Maymind, M.D.- Dr. Joppa is currently studying connections between attachment styles, physician practice characteristics, and medical specialty choice.
